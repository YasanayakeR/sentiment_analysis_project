# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project is a sentiment analysis application designed to classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze and predict sentiment from user input or datasets.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares raw text for analysis, including stopword removal (multi-language support).
- **Model Training:** Jupyter notebooks for building and evaluating sentiment analysis models.
- **Prediction Pipeline:** End-to-end pipeline for making predictions on new data.
- **User Interface:** Simple UI for interacting with the model and visualizing results.
- **Artifact Management:** Stores trained models and processed data for reproducibility.
